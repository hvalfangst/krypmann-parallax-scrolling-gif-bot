Four distinct horizontal parallax strips, each 256px tall with seamlessly tiling elements:

**Top Strip (0-256px):**  
- Color tone: Light pastel beige (#FDF5E6)  
- Elements: Small, simple geometric shapes like circles and squares in soft pastel shades (light blue, pink, mint). These shapes are evenly spaced and tile seamlessly horizontally, creating a subtle, airy background suitable for distant scenery. No complex details, just minimalistic repeating patterns.
